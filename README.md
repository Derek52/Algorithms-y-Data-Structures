# Algorithms-y-Data-Structures
This Repo is full of implementations of important algorithms, and data structures. I set out to write implementations of these things in my favorite programming language [Kotlin](kotlinlang.org) while I was prepping for a FAANG interview.


To gain an even deeper understanding of these implementations, and to practice some other programming languages, I have (slowly) been rewriting my code in other languages. I've found that attempting to write a DFS algorithm or implement a Binary Search Tree can help show you your weaknesses in a specific programming language.


This code was(and is being) written to be a personal learning experience, and is meant for me to reference. A lot of my implementations will commonly be found in a programming language's standard library. I'm not attempting to write an implementation to replace or compete with the defaults.

I've made this repo public in case anyone wants to read and attempt to learn from my code. Currently, each language I've written DSA implementations in, is simply in it's own subdirectory in this repo. Each language folder contains an IntelliJ project that can be easily imported.
